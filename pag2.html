      <p>
        Falcon 9 is a reusable, two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by
        SpaceX for the reliable and safe transport of people and payloads into
        Earth orbit and beyond. Falcon 9 is the world’s first orbital class
        reusable rocket. Reusability allows SpaceX to refly the most expensive
        parts of the rocket, which in turn drives down the cost of space access.

      <p>
        Falcon Heavy is composed of three reusable Falcon 9 nine-engine cores
        whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of
        thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. As one
        of the world’s most powerful operational rockets, Falcon Heavy can lift
        nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lbs) to orbit.
