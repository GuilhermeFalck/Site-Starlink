        On Thursday, February 3 at 1:13 p.m. EST, Falcon 9 launched 49 Starlink
        satellites to low Earth orbit from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at
        Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Falcon 9’s second stage deployed the
        satellites into their intended orbit, with a perigee of approximately
        210 kilometers above Earth, and each satellite achieved controlled
        flight.

        SpaceX deploys its satellites into these lower orbits so that in the
        very rare case any satellite does not pass initial system checkouts it
        will quickly be deorbited by atmospheric drag. While the low deployment
        altitude requires more capable satellites at a considerable cost to us,
        it’s the right thing to do to maintain a sustainable space environment.

        Unfortunately, the satellites deployed on Thursday were significantly
        impacted by a geomagnetic storm on Friday. These storms cause the
        atmosphere to warm and atmospheric density at our low deployment
        altitudes to increase. In fact, onboard GPS suggests the escalation
        speed and severity of the storm caused atmospheric drag to increase up
        to 50 percent higher than during previous launches. The Starlink team
        commanded the satellites into a safe-mode where they would fly edge-on
        (like a sheet of paper) to minimize drag—to effectively “take cover from
        the storm”—and continued to work closely with the Space Force’s 18th
        Space Control Squadron and LeoLabs to provide updates on the satellites
        based on ground radars.
